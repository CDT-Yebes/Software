# volume titles for Solaris 2.6
# written by Peter Dyballa (pete@thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de)
# on October 10 1997.
#
# With its default settings TkMan collects all volumes starting
# with the same character under a single section (for instance,
# 1, 1b, 1c, 1f, 1m and 1s are all collected under section 1).
# If multiple volumes share the same initial character
# in their man(manList) abbreviation, these
# sections are separated out in the Volumes menu.  The settings
# below separate out all volumes for Solaris 2.6.

# New users (those without ~/.tkman startup files) pick up these
# settings automatically.  The settings can also be interpolated
# into an existing startup file manually.
