This directory contains files contributed by TkMan users.  These files
are not installed, supported, or regularly updated to work with new
versions of TkMan.  They are included because some may find them
useful, and if so they prevent duplication of effort.

tkman.bitmap (colorized as TkMan.gif) - Rei Shinozuka
TkMan.xpm - by Roar Smith
AIcons.bitmap - Anthony Thyssen
hman.xbm - taken from Baudoulin Raoult's hman
tkman.xbm - Mike Eggleston
tkman.xpm - drawn by Ion Cionca, contributed by Dimitry Kloper

Possible icons for TkMan.

To use an icon, specify its path name in the Preferences/Icon dialog box

-----

outline.tcl

Demonstration of how to use the text widget's elide text feature
to implemented outlining.

-----

xman-mandesc.tcl - Dietmar Theobald (theobald@fzi.de)

Parse your old xman mandesc in TkMan.

-----

remote.tcl

This code shows how to use the `send' command to call TkMan from another
Tcl/Tk application.

-----

tkman_selection.txt - Scott Schwartz <schwartz@groucho.cse.psu.edu>
tkmanclient - Chris Siebenmann <cks@hawkwind.utcs.toronto.edu>
              changes by Anthony Baxter <anthony@aaii.oz.au>

These two provide an alternative interface to TkMan, via the X selection or
the command line, respectively.

-----

calltkman.tcl - Neil Smithline (Neil.Smithline@eng.sun.com)

Adding the code for callTkMan to your .tkman file causes tkman to
bring up a second window labeled "callTkMan".  The intent of this
window is to provide a convenient mechanism for kicking off tkman
searches without keeping the entire tkman window open on your screen.

irix_bindings.tcl -
	Paul Raines (raines@bohr.physics.upenn.edu),
	Craig Ruff (cruff@ncar.ucar.edu),
	and Scott Nelson (nelson18@llnl.gov)

Copy this file into your home directory and name it .tkman in order to
establish the many volume groupings used by SGI.  First time users
have this written as their initial .tkman automatically.  You can edit
the .tkman file to change the groupings, splitting out a group of
particular interest, or merging some if you don't like 47 different
groupings, most of which are sparsely populated.

sco_bindings.tcl - anonymous

adapt TkMan to SCO UNIX.

solaris_bindings.tcl - Will C Lauer (wcl@cadre.com)
solaris_bindings25.tcl and solaris_bindings26.tcl
	- Peter Dyballa (pete@thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de)

Instead of collecting volumes that start with same character under a single
volume listing (e.g., 1, 1b, 1c, 1f, 1m and 1s all collected under 1),
keep them separate.
