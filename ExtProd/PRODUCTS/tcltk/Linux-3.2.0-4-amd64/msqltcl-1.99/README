VERSIONS, PORTS

This is release 1.99 of msqltcl. It has been tested with Tcl 7.5,
Tk 4.1, mSQL 1.0.16 under SunOS 4.1.4. Successful ports of earlier
versions to other Unix platforms have been reported. I would expect
msqltcl to run wherever Tcl/Tk and mSQL succeed.


WHAT IS MSQLTCL?

Msqltcl is a Tcl/Tk extension providing high-level access to a Mini SQL
(mSQL) database server. Mini SQL (mSQL) is a freely available (but not
necessarily free), lightweight database engine.

Msqltcl features:
   -- supports multiple connections to one or more database servers,
   -- supports all Mini-SQL statements,
   -- returns SELECT query results either as Tcl lists, or iterates
      a script over the resulting rows,
   -- accesses information about databases, tables, columns.

Msqltcl may be configured as a dynamically loadable package on platforms
supporting this feature.

The msqltcl distribution contains a window-based Mini-Monitor (mmon)
written in Tcl/Tk and msqltcl.


UNPACKING AND INSTALLING

The msqltcl distribution comes in a file called msqltcl-X.Y.tar.gz,
where X.Y is the release number. cd to a directory under which you want
the msqltcl directory to be created. Then,

   gunzip < msqltcl-X.Y.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a new directory called msqltcl-X.Y in the current
directory and unpack the msqltcl source files in the new directory.

`cd' into the new directory. You will find additional installation
instructions in a file named INSTALL.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Obviously msqltcl is just a small addition to a much greater work done
by John Ousterhout (Tcl/Tk) and David J. Hughes (mSQL).

Msqltcl is derived from work by Tom Poindexter (tpoindex@nyx.cs.du.edu)
whose Sybtcl and Oratcl are useful patterns for Tcl database extensions.


DOCUMENTATION

A man page for msqltcl. Mmon includes on-line documentation.


REQUIREMENTS

You must have Tcl/Tk and Mini SQL.

** Tcl/Tk is available from numerous FTP sites.
<URL:ftp://ftp.sunlabs.com/pub/tcl/> is its official home.

A useful Tcl/Tk book is "Tcl and the Tk Toolkit" by John K. Ousterhout,
Addison-Wesley 1994, ISBN 0-201-63337-X.

** Mini SQL (mSQL) is a freely available (but not necessarily free),
lightweight database engine developed by David J. Hughes at Bond
University, Australia. The source (and a FAQ) can be obtained from
<URL:ftp://Bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql>.


INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL.


BUG REPORTS

Although I have made a conscientious effort to provide zero-defect
software and documentation, this release of msqltcl may contain blunders
of varying magnitudes.

Comments, suggestions, bug reports (maybe even encouragement!) should be
mailed to me at the E-mail address above. Please include some
information about your environment (platform, OS version, Tcl/Tk
version, mSQL version, msqltcl version). Please include enough
information for me to be able to reproduce any suspect behaviour. If you
have a solution to a problem, please include a patch.

I can't guarantee that I will fix your bug, but I'll do my best.
