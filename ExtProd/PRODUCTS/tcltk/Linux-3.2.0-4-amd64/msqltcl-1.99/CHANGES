msqltcl: Changes visible on the Tcl level.

** Release 1.90 **

-- Added autoconf support: many thanks to Juergen Schoenwaelder
<schoenw@cs.utwente.nl> for doing most of the job.

-- msqltcl dynamically loadable on platforms supporting this feature:
again many thanks to Juergen Schoenwaelder <schoenw@cs.utwente.nl>.

** Release 1.80 **

-- mmon thoroughly revised. Adapted to Tk 4. TclX no longer required.

-- Removed support for TclX and more than one Tcl/Tk version from the
makefile.

-- Added read-only variable msqlstatus(version) for showing the msqltcl
version.

** Release 1.50 **

-- Bug corrections: 'msqlconnect' without host name now works as
advertised. Makefile bug causing Tk to terminate with
	can't read "tk_library": no such variable
also corrected.

-- New command: 'msqlseek'. Option 'current' added to the 'msqlresult'
command.

-- 'msqlsel' now returns number of result rows for SELECT statements;
-1 if invoked with a non-SELECT statement (in addition to not setting
a pending result). There is no error in the latter case (if the
statement is well-formed).

-- Conflict management: the same message now appears as the result of
a failing commands as well as in 'msqlstatus(message)'. The failing
command is saved in 'msqlstatus(command)', a new status array element.
Only msqlstatus(code) is set for every command. The other status array
elements retain their previous values.

-- From version 1.0.6 mSQL distinguishes null values from empty
strings. A new settable status variable,

   msqlstatus(nullvalue)

determines the string msqltcl returns for null values. It is initially
the empty string -- backward compatible behaviour.

-- Support for Tcl 7.4, Tk 4.0 (betas).

-- The 'mmon' GUI mini-monitor has been added. It only works with
pre-4.0 Tk, however.
